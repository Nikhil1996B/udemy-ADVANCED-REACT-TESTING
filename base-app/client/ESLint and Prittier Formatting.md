Notes on ESLint and Prettier Formatting
ESLint and Prettier Formatting
The Popular Music Venue app comes with ESLint configuration, Prettier configuration, and VSCode settings to auto-format on save. If the auto-formatting isn't working in your setup, this might lead to tedious manual formatting before the code will run. Here are some suggestions if you're finding your code won't run without manual formatting:

1. If you want to remove the linting/ formatting requirements altogether, you can delete .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc.json .

2. If want to auto-format on save, and you're using VSCode, make sure the ESLint and Prettier extensions are installed, and not generating any errors in the output window.

3. If ESLint isn't working in your code editor, you can auto-fix anything auto-fixable by running this from the command-line (with the .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc.json files in place):

eslint --fix src/ --ext ".jsx,.js,.ts,.tsx"


Delete `‚êç`  prettier/prettier error
or sometimes it looks like this screenshot: 


This error sometimes occurs on windows machines, due to line ending differences. Here are some things to try to resolve the error:

1. Run prettier on all of the files in the project (reference: create-react-app docs): 

./node_modules/.bin/prettier --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md}"
2. Note: this will update your global git settings. Run git config --global core.autocrlf true and pull the code from GitHub again (or possibly re-clone the repo). (Reference: GitHub docs)

3. Remove the linting / formatting requirements altogether by deleting .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc.json . Note that this will also remove the benefits of linting and formatting as you're coding, so it should be used as a last resort.

Solutions that have already been applied to the course repo: 

1. update the prettier/prettier rule in the .eslintrc.json file:

"prettier/prettier": [
  "error",
  {
    "endOfLine": "auto"
  }
],
2. Set the line endings in .vscode/settings.json: 

{
    "files.eol": "\n",
}
